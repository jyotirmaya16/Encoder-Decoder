## Overview
This project is a simple application that allows users to encrypt and decrypt text using two classic methods: the **Atbash Cipher** and the **A1Z26 Encoder**. The app provides an easy-to-use interface for inputting plain text and receiving the encoded or decoded result.

### Atbash Cipher
The Atbash cipher is a simple substitution cipher that reverses the alphabet, replacing each letter with its reverse element:
- A becomes Z
- B becomes Y
- C becomes X
- And so on...
  
 For example:
- The word "HELLO" would be encoded as "svool" 

### A1Z26 Encode
The A1Z26 encoder is a simple letter-to-number substitution method where each letter of the alphabet is replaced by its position in the alphabet:
- A = 1
- B = 2
- C = 3
- ...
- Z = 26.

For example:
- The word "HELLO" would be encoded as "8 5 12 12 15"

## Features
- Encrypt and decrypt text using the Atbash cipher.
- Encode and decode text using the A1Z26 encoder.
- User-friendly interface for easy interaction.
- Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters.

## Usage
Both methods can be used for educational purposes, to learn about encryption, or for creating simple puzzles. They are not secure for any serious cryptographic application but are fun and easy to implement for basic text manipulation.
